this project is use for upload your dataset into postgres SQL

just change you dataset into dictionary format and it will upload your dataset into your database

i'm purposely used dictionary format so not only data scientist who can use this project, but also 
software developer who want to work with data scientist and kinda lazy to make the system by themself

also with dictionary format, i hope who seeing this project can at least make some sense on how data
scientist pipeline works, and can upgrade the project even further for their projects

how to use this project :
1. just make model.py object into your programs
2. initiate which database you want to use : host, databasename, user, and password to connect into database
3. add your data into database, just use dictionary format and your data automaticaly uploaded to database

for now, i just made create function from CRUD schema, for the future i will make it to serve CRUD format

changelog :
i just realize i made few mistake and didnt know how to make documentation before, so if anyone already clone earlier version 
because i made (kinda) huge change

changelog 2 :
another minor mistake, so now i update the method i used

changelog 3 :
the project is basically complete, with many change and struggle, i hope anyone who use this
code in the future can understand or even upgrade it (because i didnt even sure anyone 
can read this spaghetti code)
